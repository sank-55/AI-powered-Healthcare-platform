üöß Challenges and Solutions
Building this platform required navigating several key challenges:

Integrating Disparate Services: The core challenge was connecting the Node.js backend with the separate FastAPI service for ML models and the MongoDB database for vector search. This was resolved by designing a microservice-like architecture with secure API endpoints for seamless communication.

Handling Sensitive Data: To ensure patient privacy and security, all data transfers are handled over HTTPS. I implemented Firebase Authentication for secure user management and designed the ML models to process anonymized data.

Optimizing the AI Chatbot: To prevent inaccuracies, the chatbot was built using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). This approach retrieves specific, authoritative medical data from a vector database before generating a response, significantly reducing hallucinations and improving reliability.

üìà Future Enhancements
Personalized Dashboards: Implement user dashboards for tracking appointments, managing prescriptions, and reviewing health history.

Telemedicine Integration: Add live video call functionality for virtual consultations.

Payment Gateway: Integrate a secure payment system for consultations and pharmacy orders.

ML Model Expansion: Deploy more advanced models for a wider range of disease predictions.

Doctor-Side Portal: Develop a separate interface for doctors to manage appointments and patient records.
